`linkorgsonnx` is an R package that allows you to join datasets using neural networks in R.

# Installation

## Prerequisites:

To use the development version of the package, you must have the following installed:

1. [Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), the package manager for Rust
2. The [ONNX Runtime](https://www.onnxruntime.ai), needed for running the neural networks.

Installation for both should require copying a few commands in your terminal.
If you are looking to run the models on a GPU, please make sure that you
install the relevant GPU version. Please see the following note reguarding a
common issue compiling packages using Rust on Windows.

#### Installing Rust on Windows:

To install Rust on windows, you can use the Rust installation wizard, `rustup-init.exe`, found [at this site](https://forge.rust-lang.org/infra/other-installation-methods.html). Depending on your version of Windows, you are likely to see an error that looks something like the following when you try and compile the package:

```
error: toolchain 'stable-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu' is not installed
```

In this case, you should run `rustup install stable-x86_64-pc_windows-gnu` to install the missing toolchain. If you're missing another toolchain, simply type this in the place of `stable-x86_64-pc_windows-gnu` in the command above.

## Installing from GitHub

At the moment, the only way to install this package is from this github repository, although we hope to have pre-built binaries available on CRAN / R-Universe soon.

```{r, eval=F}
devtools::install_github("beniaminogreen/linkorgsonnx")
```
